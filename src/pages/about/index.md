### Our Mission

We exist to an extension of God’s unconditional love, acceptance, forgiveness, and empowerment.

# Core Values

#### God’s presence:

We gather corporately to experience the manifest presence of God; He inhabits the praises of His people.

### God’s Word:

We believe that the Bible is the infallible word of God and from it we can gain daily the spiritual nourishment needed to live a life surrendered to Christ.

#### God’s people:

We welcome all of God’s people regardless of race, background, social status, or religious affiliation to be a part of our church family.

### Generosity:

We don’t just teach it, we live it. We give to those who aren’t able to give back.

### Servanthood:

We exist to help and serve others.

#### Community:

We are a family of believers; it’s not just about church, we do life together!
